======================

1. If your selections aren't working and you're getting a 200 response from
server, you probably broke your javascript. Check your syntax carefully. Likely
errors:

    1. You forgot to remove a semi-colon somewhere up a chain of commands.
    2. Mismatched single/double quotes.
    3. Messed up inline return statement, too many semicolons.
